<p>
This subchapter encompasses all of the work that did not fit into other categories, which mostly deal with laboratory. When I have spare time, or when someone important to me celebrates birthday or other holiday, I like to create something with my own hands.
</p>

<p>
I learned how to crochet and embroider when I was small and it had proven invaluable on several occasions. I try every type of craft I can lay my hands on including sewing, paper crafting, leatherworking or metal work (lack of equipment and place to work are really a hindrance here). Sadly, many of things I did and have given to someone are out of reach, so below is only a partial compendium of items I created.

<h2>Presents for Boss</h2>
<p>
There is a nice tradition in our lab, that during Christmas, in case the deadlines are not that severe, we make a custom present for our boss. We try to make them funny and incorporate references to funny things happening in the lab. So far, I have been in charge of three projects and all of them turned out very well. Unfortunately most of the stuff is in Czech.

A simple adventure game, where you navigate a boss of laboratory, who has to meet a strict deadline for experiment, but none of his students are available. Therefore he is forced to remember his old experimenting days. In Czech only.
